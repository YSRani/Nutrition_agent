# Nutrition Agent ðŸ¥—

**A personalized AI-powered nutrition and meal planning assistant built using IBM watsonx.ai.**

## Overview

Nutrition Agent is an AI-driven project designed to provide **personalized meal plans, dietary recommendations, and nutrition guidance** based on user input. It leverages IBMâ€™s **watsonx.ai** platform to process user data and generate intelligent responses.

This project helps users:

- Understand their nutritional needs  
- Get customized meal plans based on age, weight, dietary restrictions, and health goals  
- Receive guidance for healthy eating and lifestyle choices  

## Features

- AI-powered meal recommendations  
- Personalized nutrition plans  
- Easy-to-use interface on IBM watsonx.ai  
- Supports multiple dietary preferences (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, low-carb, high-protein)  
- Generates reports and suggestions dynamically

## How It Works

1. Users provide personal details (age, weight, dietary restrictions, etc.).  
2. IBM watsonx.ai processes the input using AI models.  
3. The system generates **custom meal plans and nutrition advice**.  
4. Results can be viewed on the platform or exported for further use.

## Technologies Used

- **IBM watsonx.ai** â€“ AI model deployment and processing  
- AI/ML for personalized recommendations  
- (Optional) Python for pre-processing inputs or integrating APIs  

## Project Status

- Fully functional on IBM watsonx.ai  
- No standalone code repository required â€” logic is implemented entirely on IBMâ€™s cloud platform  

## Future Improvements

- Integrate with a web or mobile interface for public access  
- Add logging and tracking of user progress  
- Enable export of meal plans as PDF or CSV  
- Include more detailed analytics on nutrition habits  

## How to Use / Test

Since this project is hosted on IBM watsonx.ai, you will need:

1. An IBM watsonx.ai account  
2. Access to the workspace where the project is deployed  

Users can input their details directly on the platform and receive instant recommendations.
